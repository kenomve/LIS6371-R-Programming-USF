#Find the determinant and inverse of Matrix A annd B
A = matrix(1:100, nrow=10)
B = matrix(1:1000, nrow=10)

#determinant for Matrix A
det(A)
#determinant for Matrix A is 0
#there is no inverse for matrix A because the determinant is 0

#determinant for matrix B does not exist because the matrix is not square
#there is no inverse for matrix B because there is no determinant
